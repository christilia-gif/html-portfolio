<h1>The best movies of all time (according to Christilia)</h1>
<h2>These are my top 3 movies! Based on my taste and maybe a little of nostalgia.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>The suitcase</h3>
<p>This is an amazing movie. Has pleanty of action and plot twists and will leave you hangin!</p>
<h3>The Truman show</h3>
<p>No words needed for this masterpiece. It is trully a reality check and will leave you questioning alternative realities. <br/>
Let alone Jim Carrey being one of the best actors of all time in my sencere opinion</p>
<h3>The Purge</h3>
<p>I have a thing for "almost real" sci fi scenarios. There is something dystopian about them. Again, talks about something that if happened, would be one of our worst nightmares.  <br/>To my opinion, aliens invasion is more light-hearted than what happens in the purge.
