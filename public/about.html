<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Christilia, a 26-year-old Capricorn from the vibrant city of Athens, Greece. I’m on a mission to become a full stack developer—because why settle for just the front or back when you can have the whole cake, right? I’ve dipped my toes into the world of UI/UX with a 25-hour Udemy course (yes, I actually finished it!), and I’m constantly exploring new ways to blend logic with creativity. My artistic side refuses to be ignored—I love dancing, sketching, and starting exciting projects that I may or may not finish. Okay, fine... I usually don’t. But hey, the thrill of beginning something new is half the fun!</p>

<p>I’m the kind of person who’ll try salsa dancing one week, build a wireframe the next, and then suddenly decide to learn about color theory while sipping iced coffee in a sunlit café. My curiosity is my compass, and it often leads me to unexpected places (and half-painted canvases). I believe that being a developer doesn’t mean giving up your artistic soul—it means giving it a keyboard and letting it code in style. I want to create digital experiences that feel like dancing: fluid, expressive, and a little bit magical.</p>

<p>If you’re wondering what it’s like to be a Capricorn with a chaotic creative streak—imagine someone who makes to-do lists and then doodles all over them. I’m ambitious, yes, but also delightfully distracted. I thrive in spaces where ideas bounce around like confetti, and I’m always up for a challenge (especially if it involves learning something new or designing something beautiful). So, tell me—what’s the weirdest hobby you’ve ever tried and actually loved? I bet I’ve tried it too… or at least started it.
</p>
